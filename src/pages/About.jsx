            <p>
                I am a computer science graduate with a passion for software development. Currently, I am a student at Moringa School, pursuing software engineeing. As a self-motivated individual, I am always seeking ways to enhance my skills and create software that addresses real-world problems. My expertise lies in front-end development, where I focus on building user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional interfaces. I am seeking opportunities to collaborate with a team of developers where I can contribute my skills and gain knowledge from others. I am also open to freelance projects. Feel free to reach out if you would like to work together. I look forward to connecting with you.
